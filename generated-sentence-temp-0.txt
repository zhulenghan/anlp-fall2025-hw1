I have wanted to see this thriller for a while, and it didn't disappoint. Keanu Reeves, playing the hero John Wick, is this day. He was playing with his toy car, driving it around the living room. Suddenly, he heard a loud crash. He had broken the car and was very sad. He knew he had done something wrong. He had to be punished. He had to stay in his room all day. He was very sorry and promised to never do it again
