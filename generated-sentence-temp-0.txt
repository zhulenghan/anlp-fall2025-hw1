I have wanted to see this thriller for a while, and it didn't disappoint. Keanu Reeves, playing the hero John Wick, is the most exciting thing that I ever saw.
One day, Icela, Icela, I was just about to go outside and play when I saw a big, scary dog. It was growling and barking, and I knew it was a threat. Icela was scared and ran back inside.
